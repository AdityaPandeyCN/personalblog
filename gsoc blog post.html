<p>Welcome to my new blog! This is the second post, and I am excited to share my thoughts and experiences about Google Summer Of Code.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-this-blog-about">
<h3>What is this blog about?</h3>
<p>This blog will cover my initial experience about Gooogle Summer Of Code
with INCF(Organisation).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-organization-incf-international-neuroinformatics-coordinating-facility">
<h3>The Organization : INCF(International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility)</h3>
<p>IINCF promotes the field of neuroinformatics and aims to advance data
reuse and reproducibility in global brain research.</p>
<p>INCF works on exciting applications of computer science to medical data
and serves as an umbrella organization to many projects being carried on
throughout the world. The primary reason why INCF seemed like a natural
fit to me was because of the following factors:</p>
<p>INCF has participated as a mentoring organization in GSoC since 2011.
Interesting and well documented list of ideas (and that too released
early around December). A very systematic, well-organized and welcoming
community full of passionate highly qualified people from diverse
backgrounds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-proposal">
<h3>The Proposal</h3>
<p>I started contributing in December 2023 all the way up-to April 2024 and
began writing my Proposal around mid-March. After talking to my mentor I
quickly made my first draft with a rough estimate of what is to be done.
Writing a proposal is an iterative process. I made sure to get feedback
from my mentor Ankur Sinha sir in the organisation. Regular feedback
from him helped me to fine-tune my details about the time-line, adding
more information and making the detailed process as much detailed as it
can be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-experience">
<h3>My Experience?</h3>
<p>In the initial phase of learning the basics of Machine Learning, a senior
recommended that I watch the lectures of Geoffrey Hinton on Neural
Networks. I watched the first few lectures and understood how neural networks
are designed by taking reference from our brain. I was determined to know more
about it and found out about the NeuroML Project. I started contributing to
the NeuroML project by raising a pull request (PR). During this phase, my mentor
Ankur Sinha Sir, helped me immensely with great patience in understanding the
codebase. Unlike many other open-source projects this is very domain based and a
basic understanding of our brain is very important.I kept on commiting to the PR,
I worked on refactoring the spikes plotting file to make it more usable.
Finally, I submitted my proposal after getting a brief idea of the codebase and
my project and also after getting an assurance that I can contribute to the project.</p>
<p>I got selected for Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
My GSoC project involves developing an interactive SWC to NeuroML converter in Python.
The SWC format is widely used for representing neuronal morphology data, while NeuroML
is a standardized format for describing biophysically detailed neuronal models.
The converter I'll be working on will simplify the process of converting SWC data into
the NeuroML format, making it easier for researchers to integrate morphological data into
their computational models.</p>
<p>A SWC to NeuroML converter already exists on the neurosconstruct project developed by my other mentor
Padraig Gleeson but it is written in JAVA and a Python based converter will make the PyneuroML project
more complete.</p>
<p>One of the key components of my project is the development of
an interactive tool that will allow users to visualize and manipulate the neuronal morphology
data before converting it to NeuroML. This tool will provide researchers with a more hands-on
approach to working with their data, enabling them to make adjustments and explore different
scenarios before finalizing their models. To ensure the robustness and accuracy of the converter,
I will be testing it against a range of neuronal reconstructions from the NeuroMorpho.org database.
This extensive testing will help identify and address any potential issues or edge cases,
ultimately leading to a more reliable and efficient conversion process.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to have the opportunity to contribute to the NeuroML community and the broader
field of computational neuroscience. With my knowledge of Python, SWC, NeuroML, and some background
in computational neuroscience, I am confident in my ability to take on this challenging project.
The project will be hosted on the NeuroML GitHub page, ensuring transparency and collaboration
within the open-source community. I am deeply grateful to Google for providing this incredible
opportunity through the GSoC program and to my mentors, Ankur Sinha and Padraig Gleeson, for
their guidance and support.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>In the coming posts, I plan to post about the technical challenges I
will be facing while making through GSoC</p>
<p>I'll also share updates on any personal projects I'm working on and
the lessons I learn along the way.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me on this adventure! I'm looking forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences with you.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
