<h1>My Google Summer of Code 2025 Selection with CERN</h1>
<p>:Author: Aditya Pandey
:Date: June 28, 2025
Welcome to my GSoC journey! I'm thrilled to share the story of how my fascination with the Higgs boson discovery led me to an incredible opportunity with CERN.
From Higgs Boson Dreams to CERN Reality
Ever since I learned about the Higgs boson discovery in 2012, I've been fascinated by CERN and the incredible technology behind particle physics research. The idea that scientists could smash particles together at nearly the speed of light and discover fundamental truths about our universe felt like magic. That moment sparked a dream - I wanted to work at CERN someday.
Fast forward to 2025, and I'm excited to share that I've been selected for Google Summer of Code with CERN HSF and Princeton University's Compiler Research Team! What makes this even more special is that I was actually selected for two different projects and had to make a choice.
Why CERN HSF
When GSoC 2025 opened applications, CERN HSF was at the top of my list. I spent weeks exploring their project ideas, looking for something that would align with my interests while contributing meaningfully to the physics community. Two projects caught my attention:
Project 1: TMVA SOFIE - HLS4ML Integration
This project focused on machine learning inference optimization within ROOT's TMVA toolkit. The goal was to integrate hls4ml with SOFIE (System for Optimized Fast Inference code Emit) to enable efficient ML model inference. I had to solve a competency test for this project, demonstrating my understanding of C++ and Python programming, machine learning frameworks, and ROOT's TMVA system.
Project 2: Using ROOT in Genome Sequencing
The second project was about applying ROOT's data processing capabilities - the same technology used to analyze LHC data - to genomic data storage and analysis. This interdisciplinary approach of using particle physics tools for biological research immediately caught my attention.
The Selection Results
After weeks of preparation, proposal writing, and technical discussions with mentors, the results came in. On May 1st, I received an email from Valentin Volkl that began:
"Dear Aditya, congratulations on being selected for GSoC in our org - twice even! So you need to decide which project you want to work on."
I couldn't believe it. Being selected for one GSoC project is an achievement, but being selected for two felt surreal. Both projects were technically challenging and offered incredible learning opportunities, but I had to choose.
My Project Choice
While both projects were fascinating, I chose "Using ROOT in the field of genome sequencing" for several reasons:</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary Impact: The project bridges computational physics and bioinformatics, potentially impacting both fields
Novel Application: Applying ROOT's columnar storage and compression to genomic data is relatively unexplored territory
Real-world Relevance: With genomic data growing exponentially, efficient storage and analysis tools are critically needed
Technical Innovation: Working with ROOT's new RNTuple format and comparing it with standard bioinformatics tools like Samtools</p>
<p>I confirmed my choice to Valentin: "I would like to confirm that 'Using ROOT in the field of genome sequencing' is my preferred project choice for GSoC 2025."
Building on Previous Experience
This isn't my first GSoC participation. My previous experience taught me valuable lessons about:</p>
<p>Project scope management: Understanding what's achievable in the timeframe
Community engagement: The importance of regular communication with mentors
Documentation: Keeping detailed records of progress and challenges
Open source contribution: Writing clean, maintainable code that others can build upon</p>
<p>This experience gave me confidence in tackling another challenging project and helped me better evaluate which project would allow me to make the most significant contribution.
Project Overview
My selected project focuses on extending GeneROOT capabilities - applying CERN's ROOT framework to genomic data analysis. The core objectives include:</p>
<p>Compression Analysis: Comparing ROOT's compression with standard genomics tools like Samtools
RNTuple Migration: Exploring ROOT's next-generation RNTuple format for genomic data storage
Performance Benchmarking: Analyzing file splitting techniques and storage optimization
Cross-domain Innovation: Bringing particle physics data analysis expertise to bioinformatics</p>
<p>Why This Matters: ROOT routinely achieves 10-50% file size reductions and multiple times faster read throughput. Applied to the massive genomic datasets generated by modern sequencing technologies, this could revolutionize how biological research is conducted.
Working with CERN Mentors
I'm incredibly fortunate to work with world-class mentors:</p>
<p>Martin Vasilev from University of Plovdiv
Jonas Rembser from CERN
Fons Rademakers from CERN</p>
<p>These are the same brilliant minds who've been instrumental in developing ROOT and analyzing the data that led to groundbreaking discoveries in particle physics.
What's Next?
As I prepare to start this project, I'm filled with excitement and gratitude. That young student who was amazed by the Higgs boson discovery never imagined they'd someday be working on CERN technology, contributing to open-source software that could impact both particle physics and biology.
The next few months will be focused on diving deep into ROOT's architecture, understanding genomic data formats, and exploring the possibilities when you apply particle physics tools to biological problems.
In the coming posts, I plan to share:</p>
<p>Technical deep-dives into ROOT's RNTuple format
Performance benchmarks comparing ROOT with traditional genomics tools
Challenges and breakthroughs in applying physics computing to biology
Lessons learned from working with the CERN development community</p>
<p>This represents an important step toward my goal of contributing to the scientific community that first inspired my interest in computational physics.
Thank you for joining me on this adventure! I'm looking forward to documenting this incredible journey at the intersection of particle physics and genomics.
Happy reading!</p>
